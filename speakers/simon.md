## Biography

Simon has been working as a software engineer since 2006, in which time he's done work for the likes of Gitpod, DPD, Specsavers, British Path√©, the Red Cross and others. Initially specialising in the NodeJS ecosystem, he's used pretty much all of the major languages over the years and since 2017 has been focused on building DevOps solutions and Cloud-native applications that help engineers to work faster and more productively.

When not behind a computer he's a keen gardener, beekeeper and makes his own sausages.

He hates talking about himself in the third person.
