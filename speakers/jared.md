Jared has spent the last 6 years focused exclusively on introducing Kubernetes to startup and enterprise organizations and has a great command of the cloud native ecosystem and its orchestration complexities. Building Kubefirst started as a passion project on nights and weekends where John and Jared worked to reduce the barrier of entry for Kubernetes and Cloud Native.
